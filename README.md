# django-eurowiki
*Django* project in *wikidata* style, relying on the *CommonS Platform*, also known a *CommonSpaces*.

This is the starter app of a *Django* project aimed at allowing a comparison of all EU countries,
based mainly on the image that they have of themselves,
with a view to the opportunities for the valorisation of the variety of their institutions and traditions.

The specific data architecture will try to emulate that of Wikidata, by relying on RDF.

To host this specific application we will use the *CommonS Platform* (https://github.com/gtoffoli/commons),
to be able to reuse plenty of functions supporting groupwork and the building of digital artifacts.
